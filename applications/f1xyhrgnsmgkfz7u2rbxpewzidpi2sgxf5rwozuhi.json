    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "The 1000 Genomes Project created a catalogue of common human genetic variation, using openly consented samples from people who declared themselves to be healthy. The reference data resources generated by the project remain heavily used by the biomedical science community.\r\n\r\nThe International Genome Sample Resource (IGSR) maintains and shares the human genetic variation resources built by the 1000 Genomes Project. We also update the resources to the current reference assembly, add new data sets generated from the 1000 Genomes Project samples and add data from projects working with other openly consented samples.",
